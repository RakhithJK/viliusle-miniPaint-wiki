Looking to contribute something to miniPaint? Here's how you can help.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Also **please use tabs** for code format.

**Remember**:
- Do not edit **dist/*** directly! Those files are automatically generated.
- Better do not edit **src/js/core/*** files if possible.

**Contributing process:**

1. Fork the project & clone locally.
2. If you cloned a while ago, get latest changes.
4. Do the work, write good commit messages.
5. Push to your origin repository.
6. Create a new Pull Request in GitHub.
7. Respond to any code review feedback.
